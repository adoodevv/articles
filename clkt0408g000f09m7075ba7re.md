🚀 My tech journey started in Grade 5 with a robotics club. The first time I saw a robot move, I was hooked. From building and competing for my school to winning national and international competitions, it was an incredible ride. 🏆

In high school, my interest in Python sparked. I felt like a true computer nerd, crunching numbers and writing lines of code. I started learning from Mosh Hamedani on YouTube and even started coding competitions with my friends. Currently, I'm in my first year of College. 🐍

However, despite my achievements, I often felt lost. I had this vast knowledge but didn't know how to apply it. I wanted to dive into software development, specifically full-stack, but I didn't know where to start.

Fortunately, I found some mentors who have been helping me navigate this new path. The journey is still ongoing, and I'm piecing it together bit by bit. 🌐

Recently, I've started sharing my journey on social media. I aim to engage with fellow tech enthusiasts and learn from their experiences. You can join me in this journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adoodevv?t=hqtOuHeqidx8Zo4WwGLOSg&s=09), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adoojoey?utm_source=qr&r=nametag), [github](https://github.com/adoodevv) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-adoo-22a4691b2).
